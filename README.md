Start Date: 1 February, 2024

Supervisor: [Alf Köhn-Zeeman](https://www.igvp.uni-stuttgart.de/team/Koehn-Seemann/)

**Description**: The objective is to study the physics of Helicon waves to improve the design of Plasma Wakefield Accelerators, bring some light into the energy deposition mechanisms of the H-wave into the plasma, optimize efficiency for different antenna geometries and model the dissipation mechanisms. 
To address this task, the project is divided into 3 parts. The
