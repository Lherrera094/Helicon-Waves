<h3 align="center"> Helicon-Waves Physics </h3> 

Start Date: 1 February, 2024

Supervisor: [Alf Köhn-Zeeman](https://www.igvp.uni-stuttgart.de/team/Koehn-Seemann/)

**Description**: The objective is to study the physics of Helicon waves to improve the design of Plasma Wakefield Accelerators, bring some light into the energy deposition mechanisms of the H-wave into the plasma, optimize efficiency for different antenna geometries and model the dissipation mechanisms. 
To address this task, the project is divided into 3 parts. During the first, the focus will be on understanding the physics of helicon waves and the numérical models to develop three main analysis software.

* **Helicon Wave Physics Analysis**: C code to simulate the characteristics of Helicon wave physics for parametric studies.

* **FOCAL**:

* **COMSOL**:
