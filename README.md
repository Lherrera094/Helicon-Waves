<h3 align="center"> Helicon-Waves Physics </h3> 

Start Date: 1 February, 2024

Supervisor: [Alf Köhn-Zeeman](https://www.igvp.uni-stuttgart.de/team/Koehn-Seemann/)

**Description**: The objective is to study the physics of Helicon waves to improve the design of Plasma Wakefield Accelerators, bring some light into the energy deposition mechanisms of the H-wave into the plasma, optimize efficiency for different antenna geometries and model the dissipation mechanisms. 
To address this task, the project is divided into 3 parts. During the first, the focus will be on understanding the physics of helicon waves and the numérical models to develop three main analysis software.

* **Helicon Wave Physics Analysis**: C code to simulate the characteristics of Helicon wave physics for parametric studies. The program receives an input file where the user provides the values of the folder name to save all data, plasma density (n_0 m^-3), magnetic field (B_0 T), wave frequency (W Hz), wave number (K m^-1), plasma radius (a m), collission frequency (v), and azimuthal mode number (m). The program returns: a file containing the main parameters for the plasma, the H and TG wave, a file for each Magnetic and Electric field for each wave which contains the radial evolution, and the eigenvalues solutions for the wave number (K).
